# Entities
#
# Data models with their own capability requirements and state.
# These represent the core domain objects in the system.
#
# Entities can invoke capabilities based on their state.
# For example, a Gallery entity might invoke images:manage when admin is editing.

# Example entity:
#
# entity-id:
#   name: EntityName
#   type: entity
#   capabilities:
#     - capability-name  # invoked based on state conditions
#   state:
#     - field: type
