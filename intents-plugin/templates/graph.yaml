# Feature Graph
#
# The architectural skeleton: what the system IS.
# Features reference capabilities by name (defined in capabilities.yaml).
#
# Status values: new | planned | in-progress | implemented | broken
#
# Inheritance: Children inherit parent capabilities automatically.
# Use capability:mode syntax to specify which mode (e.g., images:consume vs images:manage).
