# Capabilities Catalog
#
# Interfaces that features consume. Defined by ADRs, implemented via tech stack.
# Features reference these by name (e.g., "persistence:read", "images:consume").
#
# Categories:
#   ui       - How things look (design system, theming)
#   storage  - Where data lives (database, localStorage)
