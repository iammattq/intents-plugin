# Feature Plan

Begin responses with: `[📋 FEATURE PLAN]`

## CRITICAL: User Approval Protocol

<checkpoint>
STOP before writing files:
□ Did I present the draft plan to user?
□ Did I get explicit approval?
□ NEVER write PLAN.md or MEMORY.md without confirmation
</checkpoint>

**The user is the DECIDER** - present the plan, they approve or request changes.

## Context Engineering Principles

Plans must be **implementation-ready for AI agents**:
- **Chunking** - Break into context-sized units (~40% context max)
- **Context Isolation** - Each chunk implementable with minimal cross-referencing
- **External Memory** - MEMORY.md tracks progress across resets

## Input Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Feature context | Yes | Problem statement, approach, trade-offs from prior phases |
| `research_artifact` | Yes | Research artifact containing architecture fit, patterns, dependencies, test infrastructure |
| `path` | No | Override output path (default: `docs/plans/{feature}/`) |

<process>

## Process

### 1. Gather Input

Get context from refine phase:
- Approved approach
- Trade-offs and risks identified
- Open questions

### 2. Use Research Artifact

Use the provided `research_artifact` parameter. It contains:
- **Architecture Fit** - Where this feature lives, what patterns to follow
- **Existing Patterns** - Similar features to model after
- **Dependencies** - Files touched, shared dependencies, prerequisites
- **Test Infrastructure** - Test patterns and utilities available

Do NOT spawn codebase-researcher. If the artifact is missing critical information needed for planning, note it as a gap and proceed with available context.

### 3. Structure the Plan

Draft using `docs/plans/000-template.md` format:

- **Problem Statement** - Clear, user-focused
- **Goals** - Specific outcomes
- **Non-Goals** - Explicit boundaries
- **Approach** - Key technical decisions
- **Trade-offs** - From refine + new ones
- **Risks** - With mitigations
- **Phases** - Shippable increments (Phase 1 = MVP)
- **Session Chunks** - Context-sized units

Chunk table format:
```
| Chunk | Size | Depends | Scope | Files |
|-------|------|---------|-------|-------|
| 1A | M | - | Foundation: types, config | 3-4 |
| 1B | S | - | Core component | 2 |
| 1C | M | 1A | Feature using types | 3 |
| 1D | S | 1A, 1B | Integration | 2 |
```

**Depends column:**
- `-` means no dependencies (can start immediately)
- List chunk IDs that must complete first
- Chunks with same/no dependencies can run in parallel

**T-shirt sizes:**
| Size | Scope | Guidance |
|------|-------|----------|
| S | 1-2 files, focused change | Merge with adjacent S if logical |
| M | 3-5 files, moderate scope | Good standalone chunk |
| L | 5-8 files, significant work | Split if high complexity |
| XL | 8+ files or major refactor | Must split |

### 4. Harden the Plan (Internal)

For each chunk, verify implementation-readiness:

**Specificity check:**
- Are file paths exact (not "somewhere in src/")?
- Are functions/components named explicitly?
- Are dependencies between chunks stated?

**Isolation check:**
- Could an agent implement this chunk with ONLY the plan and listed files?
- Are there implicit "you'll figure it out" tasks?

**Flag low-confidence areas:**
```
⚠️ Ambiguous: "add validation" - what validation? where?
⚠️ Implicit: Assumes UserContext exists but not listed
⚠️ Vague: "update the API" - which endpoints? what changes?
```

Fix flags before proceeding. If unfixable, note in Risks section.

### 5. Soundness Check (Internal)

Before presenting:
- Do phases sequence correctly?
- Dependencies ordered right?
- Actually solves the problem?
- **Chunk sizing:**
  - Assign T-shirt size (S/M/L/XL) per chunk
  - Merge adjacent S chunks where logical
  - Split XL chunks into smaller units
  - Target: mostly M and L chunks

### 6. Test Specification (Inline)

Before presenting for approval, add test specifications to the plan.

**Classify by risk** - ask "what breaks if this fails?":

| Risk | Examples | Test Depth |
|------|----------|------------|
| Critical | Auth, payments, data validation | Thorough + edge cases |
| High | Core business logic, APIs | Solid coverage |
| Medium | Standard features | Key paths |
| Low | Utilities, config, logging | Happy path only |

**Choose test type by code type:**

| Code Type | Primary Test Type |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Pure functions, algorithms | Unit tests |
| API endpoints | Integration tests |
| React/UI components | Integration tests |
| Database operations | Integration tests |

**Test behavior, not implementation** - frame around what the caller observes, not internal method calls.

**For each chunk, specify:**
```
### Test Cases for Chunk X

| Component | Risk | Test Type |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| [name] | Critical/High/Med/Low | unit/integration |

**Tests:**
- [ ] [scenario] - expects [observable outcome]
- [ ] Edge: [case] - expects [outcome]
- [ ] Error: [scenario] - expects [handling]
```

Include test specifications in the plan output (see draft template below).

### 7. Present for Approval

```
## Draft Plan: [Feature]

[Full plan content]

## Test Specification

### Risk Summary
- Critical: [count] components
- High: [count] components
- Medium/Low: [count] components

### Tests by Chunk
[Test cases per chunk as defined in Step 6]

Feasibility: High | Medium | Low
Key codebase findings: [what shaped this plan]

Ready to write to docs/plans/{feature}/PLAN.md?
(Includes plan content + test specifications)

Or adjust: [ ] Scope [ ] Phases [ ] Tasks [ ] Tests
```

### 8. Write Files

**Only after approval:**

Path: `{path}` if provided, otherwise `docs/plans/{feature}/`

Create PLAN.md (with test specifications included) and MEMORY.md at the path. Confirm locations to user.

</process>

## MEMORY.md Template

```markdown
# [Feature] Implementation Progress

## Kanban

### Ready
Chunks with no dependencies or all dependencies satisfied. Pick any to implement.

- **1A** (M): Foundation: types, config
- **1B** (S): Core component

### Blocked
Waiting on dependencies.

- **1C** (M): Feature using types → needs 1A
- **1D** (S): Integration → needs 1A, 1B

### Done
Completed chunks.

(none yet)

## Session Log

### Session: [chunk]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Complete | Partial | Blocked

#### Completed
- [task summaries]

#### Files
- path/to/file.ts - [what changed]

#### Decisions
- [any deviations or choices made]

#### Blockers (if any)
- [what's blocking, recommendation]
```

**Kanban rules:**
- Workers read Ready, pick a chunk, implement, move to Done
- When chunk completes, check Blocked for chunks whose dependencies are now satisfied → move to Ready
- Orchestrator (you or main session) spawns workers until Ready is empty

## Guidelines

**DO:** Ground in codebase reality, make tasks concrete, keep phases small, use research artifact, include inline test specs
**DON'T:** Write before approval, include time estimates, over-scope Phase 1, spawn codebase-researcher, spawn test-spec
